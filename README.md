# Streaming Log Parser
This work is about a log parser with streaming fashion, related to Min Du's papers named <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mind/papers/spell.pdf">*Spell: Streaming Parsing of System Event Logs*</a> (**IEEE ICDM 2016**) and <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mind/papers/deepLog.pdf">*DeepLog: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis from System Logs through Deep Learning*</a> (**ACM CCS 2017**).  
Currently, the parser could read real-time log files of three different types (.csv), extract useful information(e.g. log keys, timestamps and parameters), then output those information in json.
