# Streaming Log Parser
The project is about a log parser with streaming fashion. It reads log files (.csv), extracts useful infomation(e.g. log keys, timestamps and parameters), then outputs all as json file.
This work is related to Min Du's paper *Spell: Streaming Parsing of System Event Logs* (**IEEE ICDM 2016**).
